               |__/   Welcome to the code viewer
```

# What am I looking at?
You are viewing snippets, pieces of code or/and full code of several projects I am working on.
The projects are seperated by the root directory seen in the tree-view.

# How to use
On your right hand side you can see a tree-view of all the files you can view.
If you are on your mobile phone, you will find the tree below this pane.

Click on any of the valid files and it will load up the code.
Code is syntax coloured, hovering over the pane will display what language the code is written/parsed in.

You also have access to several controls on your right hand side(below for mobile users).
The magnifying glass with a plus zooms the code in,
The magnifying glass with a minus zooms the code out,
The lightbulb either darkens the background or turns it back on,
The house icon is just a house icon and clicking on it brings to the main page.

# Purpose
Project Artemis always aims to be fully open-source, 
and github is not always nice since their API is limited and very restrictive on how many calls you can make to it.
So here you can review code of the project too.

# Credits
The syntax/code viewer is done by Prism.js.
I can't be arsed to write that myself, no need to reinvent the wheel on that one.

Node.js is what Arrow and Bow are written for.
WS is a node package basically a websocket.
