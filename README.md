## :herb: **Project Artemis**
*Project Artemis is the umbrella name for all projects revolving the custom Discord API library.
The website is also named Project Artemis for convinient purposes, for clarity it will be displayed as website in this file.
Each section will hold some information regarding the project as well as the relevant links to the project directories.
Please note that I work alone on this project, so things may develop slowly.*

> :bulb: **Note:** Anything going wrong is on you, not me.

## :herb: **webSite**
This is actually called Project Artemis, but will be refered to here as the website.
The website holds a code viewer and various tools in the future for managing project Arrow.

## :herb: **Project Arrow**
Project Arrow is the name of the bot being build on top of the library when ready.
When used it will be on Discord under the name Artemis, but testing is done on Project Artemis.

> :warning: **Warning:** Link is dead at the moment because the library is not finished.

## :herb: **Project Bow**
Project Bow is the name of the library being developed.
Most likely this name will stick for it as it's a convinient name.
