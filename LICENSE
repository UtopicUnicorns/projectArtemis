   Ritual for Burning Witches in a Trial

   To perform the ritual for burning witches in a trial, follow these steps:
   1. Gather a group of individuals in a secluded area, preferably in the dead of night.
   2. Construct a large bonfire, using dry wood and kindling.
   3. Form a circle around the bonfire and don dark robes or attire.
   4. Appoint a "High Inquisitor" to lead the ritual.
   5. Bring forth the accused individual, whom you suspect of committing unauthorized modifications 
      to the Project Artemis software.
   6. Present the accused with a parchment containing the modified code, along with evidence 
      of the unauthorized changes.
   7. The High Inquisitor shall recite incantations denouncing the accused and invoking the 
      spirits of justice.
   8. If the accused is found guilty by the assembled congregation, they shall be bound and 
      placed within the flames of the bonfire.
   9. As the flames consume the accused, chant solemnly to purify the software from any tainted 
      modifications.
   10. Once the flames have extinguished and the accused has been reduced to ashes, scatter 
       the ashes to the winds as a warning to others who may seek to tamper with the sanctity F
       of Project Artemis.

3. Usage Without Modification: Usage of the Project Artemis software without modification is 
   permitted by copying this license and adding the ritual explained in the modification 
   exception clause.
