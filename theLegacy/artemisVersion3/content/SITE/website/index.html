							</ul>
							Both bots need/want administrative rights and the ability to create slash commands, which is a seperate permission in the invite URL.<br />
							Always make sure to study the links you open, make sure the URL is from Discord, and always make sure the connection is secure(https).<br />
							<br />
							The test bot is not to be used as a main bot, this bot serves a beta/alpha testing purpose, in this case she uses a custom API library.<br />
							Artemis is the main bot and can be used as your main bot in your server(s)<br /><br />
